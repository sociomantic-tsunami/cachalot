Docker Images Generation
========================

The ``build-img`` script can generate images for a particular distro based on
only one Dockerfile.

The ``docker/`` directory contains all the script needed to use when building
images.

Please take a look to the Makefile for configuration options.

`make`, `make all` and `make build` will build the docker images locally. If no
`TAG` variable is specified, then only the images with the form
`ORG/IMG:DIST-vX` will be generated, as well as the `ORG/IMG` which will only
be tagged for the `LATEST_DIST` distribution.

If `make build TAG=v2.0.1` is used (for example), the image
`ORG/IMG:DIST-v2.0.1` will be tagged too.

If a `TAG` is specified but is a pre-release (as per SemVer, i.e. it contains
a `-`), the default tagged image will be `ORG/IMG:DIST-vX-test` (instead of
`ORG/IMG:DIST-vX`) and `ORG/IMG` will not be tagged at all.

`make push` will push all the images that would be generated by `make build`
(same rules apply for `TAG`).
