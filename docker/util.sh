# This function installs packages with specific versions and also pin them
# (with prio 990) to those versions by appending pinning information to
# /etc/apt/preferences.d/cachalot, so they are not upgraded accidentally.
#
# All packages should be specified with version: pkg=version.
#
# Version can have wildcards, see apt-get/apt_preferences documentation for
# details
